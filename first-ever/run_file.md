# how to run a file

first all you are going to do is compile your c file into an executable. you do so by typing: "gcc filename.c -o program_name"

for example if you type "gcc main.c -o main", this will create a file called main.

to run this main file all you need to do is type "./main".

note that if you make changes to your code and type the same exact commands again, the terminal will understand that you changed your file and it will not create a new one.
